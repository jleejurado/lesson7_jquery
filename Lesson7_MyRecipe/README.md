### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned that using jQuery and Document Object Model (DOM)traversal statements is a great way to preview and interact with various layers of the code without actively changing the code itself.
2. I learned that reusing code is not a taboo within coding. It is actually a common occurance that can help developers return to the original functuion or purpose of the code as well as acting as a guideline or template for future useages.
3. I learned that jQuery serves as a kind of short cut for JavaScript. jQuery is a cross-browser library; this means that it automatically includes alternate code where it is necessary in order to support different browsers.
